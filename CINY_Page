    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Located in New Rochelle, New York – just 25 minutes from New York City and its 23,000 restaurants – the Culinary Institute of New York (CINY) is an award-winning, nationally recognized culinary institute that provides students with a combination of theoretical education and hands-on experience in culinary arts, pastry arts, and hospitality management. With access to state-of-the-art instructional facilities designed to simulate the kitchens of restaurants, hotels and large production operations, students receive personal instruction and mentorship from a faculty of ACF-certified chefs and experienced industry professionals who are committed to their success. CINY has been ranked one of the top ten culinary schools in the Northeastern US and in the top twenty nation-wide. In the few years since our founding in 2009, our program has produced award-winning culinary teams, students, faculty and staff, as well as a critically acclaimed student-run restaurant, The Dining Lab, deemed a "training ground for students" by The Wall Street Journal and "the little kitchen that could" by The New York Times. Our culinary competition team has won close to 900 ACF medals and has been named the 2018 Northeast Regional Champions.</p>
    <h2>Academics</h2>
    <p>CINY’s curriculum is built on three principles: Pride, Passion, and Professionalism. Whether our students are looking to excel in culinary arts, pastry arts, or hospitality management, our courses will provide them with the technical, theoretical, and practical knowledge and skills they need to build an impactful career in their field of choice. Students receive professional instruction and personal mentorship from a faculty of experienced industry professionals – many of whom are certified by the American Culinary Federation (ACF) – including Dean Frank Costantino, named Chef of the Year by the ACF Long Island Chapter, and pastry instructor Ebow Dadzie, who was named one of the 2014 Top Ten Pastry Chefs in the U.S. by Dessert Professional.</p>
    <h2>Campus Life</h2>
    <p>CINY boasts a strong, diverse and supportive campus community that provides students with ample opportunities to enhance their personal and professional development outside of the classroom. By joining student groups such as the Professional Convention Management Association, the Culinary Arts Service Club, and the Baking and Pastry Club, many CINY students make meaningful contributions to the greater community through participating in local fundraising, volunteering and charitable events.</p>
